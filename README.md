Tea Randomizer
==============

I couldn't decide what tea I wanted to drink so I just created this script that will randomly choose a tea that I inputted into a predefined array. I never have to make such a dificult decision again!

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Just copy the tea.py script into a director and create a permanent alias that will run the script in your terminal. I chose the alias `tea`.

You'll notice that `tea.py` contains a multidimensional array of teas. the first group of teas should only contain teas with caffeine and the second group should only contain those without caffeine. Feel free to change the list for your own uses.

Parameters & Flags
------------------

* `-c`, `--caf`, `--caffeinated` - Only return teas that contain caffeine
* `-d`, `--decaf`, `--decaffeinated` - Only return teas that do not contain caffeine
