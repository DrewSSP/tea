# Tea Selector
I couldn't decide which tea I wanted to drink from my collection so I whipped up this script that decides for me. I threw it into my bin directory and created an alias that maps the word 'tea' to the command that runs the script. I can specify whether I want caffeinated or decaffeinated tea by using -d and -c flags.
